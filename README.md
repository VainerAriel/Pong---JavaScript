# Pong---JavaScript
Ariel Vainer

I recently began learning JavaScript in order to improve my web development skills and expand my knowledge.  My prior experience with Java and Processing helped me quickly pick up the basics,  and I decided to demonstrate my abilities by creating a simple game called Pong.  While this project is not an exhaustive representation of my abilities,  it was made in just two days (around 4-5 hours) and demonstrates my progress in learning JavaScript and game development.  

The game runs smoother and faster in chrome than in firefox.
